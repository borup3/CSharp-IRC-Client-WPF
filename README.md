# CSharp-IRC-Client-WPF
A WPF-based IRC client written in C#.

## http://thecode.cafe

This code has been open-sourced as part of my website http://thecode.cafe where you can see a follow-up
post here: http://thecode.cafe/foss/csharp-irc-client-wpf.

I use this IRC client on a daily basis so I'm aware of its shortcomings and if they're not fixed then it's simply because I don't care.
It's open-source so feel free to do it yourself and submit a pull request.

## Download

You can download the binary here: http://thecode.cafe/download/CodeCafe_IRC.zip. It may not be up-to-date with the code (in which case you should compile it yourself).
Last build: June 6, 2017

## Information

This IRC client is written in C# on Microsoft's fairly annoying but comprehensive WPF gui framework.
It was written from the ground up in little over a day for the "Live Chat" plugin in Parakeet 2 (http://parakeet-ide.org).

I isolated the code into a standalone application (this repository contains that under the MIT license)
that is based on something else I took from Parakeet 2: the "base style app" (see this repository https://github.com/borup3/WPF-Base-Style-App). 

The base style app this IRC client is built on is a fully-styled WPF application using the Parakeet 2 theme.
If you only want the base style app, see the link above.

## Pull Requests & License

You're free to fork this project and to submit pull requests to this repository. It's released under the MIT license so knock yourself out. I do appreciate if you tell me what you're using the code for, purely out of interest (and a potential blogging topic on my website http://thecode.cafe if it's really cool).
If you make nice changes on a fork or personal project, everyone would benefit if you submit a pull request to bring those changes into this repository as well.
